wiki ideas:

- Pre-Commit Hooks
- Principles:
  - conservative addition of new node modules
  - "render optimized" by default
  - eslint produces warnings only (for DX) and just does not allow to commit any warning
  - Playwright tests should use accessible selectors, like findByRole or findByLabelText
- Bezeichnungen ("resource" = file/folder/symlink)
- "Libraries & Tools we use" (react-aria, ImmerJS+use-context-selector)

testing:

- yarn run playwright install
- javascript debug terminal fÃ¼r Playwright Test Debugging
